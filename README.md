# Implementation-Of-Fp-growth-and-Apriori-Algorithm-On-Chess-and-Kosarak-Dataset
Chess Dataset The chess dataset was prepared by Roberto Bayardo from the UCI datasets and PUMSB. The dataset has 75 items in the overall transactions and the total number of transactions is 3,196. On each row, the items are separated with whitespace between them. We have applied both state-of-the-art Apriori and Fp-growth algorithms on this dataset and compared their time complexity based on different thresholds. The minimum threshold we used it 60% and increased it by 5% on each iteration up to 95%.
